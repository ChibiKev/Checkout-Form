# Checkout-Form
This was an individual assignment from CSC 47300: Website Design to create and design a checkout form.

## The Assignment
- Build a checkout form. See this link as an [example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/checkout/). You should have a billing address section, shipping address section, payment section, and a cart section.
- If the checkbox “Shipping address is the same as my billing address” is clicked, then the shipping address section shouldn’t appear.
- Add null/empty validation to each input. Your validation can happen after users type in or on submit click.
- Push your code to git (any repo) and submit the link in your HW. This should not be 1 huge commit. Commit & push small updates as you work. I will also require the code in Gradescope. It has a plagiarism detection feature.
- I should be able to simply clone your repo & open your HTML file in my browser to run it. Meaning, you can use bootstrap, sass, etc, but no dependencies on webpack, node, etc.
